# ISM/ISMC manifests generation

harmonic_external_asset_ism_ismc_generation_tool is a command line tool to generate the ISM/ISMC manifest for the .mp4 files stored in Azure containers.
The tool parses .mp4 and .cmft files from an Azure container, generates .ism and .ismc manifests if they do not exist, and loads them into the Azure container. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Python libs:
  - azure-core==1.29.4
  - azure-storage-blob==12.8.1
  - azure-identity==1.14.1
  - construct==2.8.8
  - pycountry==23.12.7
  - webvtt-py==0.5.1
  - ttconv==1.2.0

## Supported codecs
### Video codecs
- AVC
- HEVC
### Audio codecs
- AAC-LC
- AAC-HE (when it's compatible with AAC-LC and we interpret it as AAC-LC)
- E-AC3
### Subtitles
- WebVTT (conversion to IMSC1)

## Supported extensions:
### media formats:
- .mp4
- .mpi
- .ismv
- .isma
- .cmft

### text formats
- .ttml (raw mode only)
- .vtt (raw mode and conversion to CMFT)

## How to run
### With Azure Storage
```
python3 main.py -connection_string=<Azure storage account's connection string> -container_name=<Azure container name>
```
or
```
python3 main.py
```
in case if the configuration file azure_config.json has been filled (the configuration file shall be situated in the same folder as the main.py file).

### With Local Directory
```
python3 main.py -local_directory=/path/to/directory/with/mp4/files
```
This mode processes MP4 files from a local directory and generates ISM/ISMC manifests in the same directory. This option is completely independent of Azure and does not require any Azure configuration.
WebVTT-to-CMFT conversion is supported in local mode as well as Azure mode.

### azure_config.json
azure_config.json - configuration file may contain the following fields: connection_string, account_name, account_key, container_name:
```
{
  "connection_string": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=flametestextassetstorage;AccountKey=<key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
  "account_name": "flametestextassetstorage",
  "account_key": "<key>",
  "container_name": "test2"
}
```
**Note:** The `local_directory` option is only available as a command-line argument (`-local_directory`) and cannot be configured in the azure_config.json file.
It's possible to set the `connection_string`  field or `account_name` and `account_key` .
If only the `account_name` and `account_key` fields are specified, the connection string is formed from them.
If all fields are set, only the `connection_string` field value is used. In this case the `account_name` and `account_key` fields are ignored.

Azure connection string can be found in Azure Portal → Storage container → Access keys → Connection string

## Configuration Options

### command-line
```
python3 main.py -is_multithreading
```
Currently ISM/ISMC generation tool supports two modes: one-threaded and multi-threaded. Multi-threaded mode uses the maximum amount of threads your system can handle.

```
python3 main.py -local_copy
```
Run with local generation of ISM/ISMC (debug)

```
python3 main.py -overwrite_manifest
python3 main.py -no_overwrite_manifest
```
Control whether canonical manifest names are replaced. The default is `true` in local mode and
`false` in Azure mode. When overwrite is disabled, the tool preserves existing manifests and
creates a matching `_new`, `_new2`, ... ISM/ISMC pair.

### Configuration file
The application also supports the following configuration options in `azure_config.json`:

### overwrite_manifest (boolean, mode-specific default)
Controls whether canonical manifest names are replaced. When omitted, it defaults to `true` in
local mode and `false` in Azure mode. Command-line overwrite flags take precedence over this value.

### Manifest Generation Behavior
When manifests are generated:
- The manifest base name is chosen deterministically: an existing `.ism` name is preferred;
  otherwise the first supported media filename in case-insensitive sort order is used.
- Text, CMFT, and MPI index files are not used as the base name source.
- If `overwrite_manifest=true`: canonical `.ism`/`.ismc` names are replaced.
- If `overwrite_manifest=false`: existing manifests are preserved and a matching `_new`, `_new2`,
  ... pair is generated.

### convert_webvtt (boolean, default: false)
Controls how WebVTT files are handled:
- **false**: VTT files are added to manifests as raw WebVTT (FourCC="WVTT")
- **true**: VTT files are converted to IMSC1, packaged as CMFT, and added to manifests as CMFT (FourCC="IMSC")

## Utilities for Azure
```bash
python3 upload_azure_asset.py -asset_zip_name=<zip_file>     # unzip and upload an asset in Azure Blob (before calling the main process)
python3 remove_azure_asset.py     # remove an asset from Azure Blob
```

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest
pytest tests/integration_tests/ -v # run test subset for manifest generation
pytest tests/conversion_tests/ -v # run test subset for manifest generation
```

Generate JSON test assets with:
```bash
python3 generate_test_data.py -output_name=<output_file_without_extension>
```

## IDR-Aligned Segment Detection

For non-fragmented MP4 files that carry no segmentation info, the tool must determine a segment duration for the manifest. It does so by detecting IDR (Instantaneous Decoder Refresh) pictures — the only frames where a decoder can safely start playback.

The algorithm reads the STSS (Sync Sample) box to identify sync samples, then fetches the first bytes of each sample's NAL units to verify whether they are true IDR frames (H.264 NAL type 5) or IRAP frames (H.265 NAL types 16–21), as opposed to non-IDR I-pictures which may also appear in STSS. Only the first 15 sync samples are inspected for efficiency.

If the IDR interval is constant, it is used as the segment period (with a 2-second minimum, doubling the period if needed). If not constant, the tool falls back to fixed 2-second segments. This ensures manifest segments align with actual random access points whenever possible, enabling seamless playback start and stream switching.

Supported video codecs: AVC (`avc1`) and HEVC (`hvc1`). For files without STSS data or for audio-only tracks, the original STSS list is used as-is without NAL filtering.

## VTT to CMFT feature

A new feature has been added: converting WebVTT files found in the Azure container to CMFT files before manifest generation.

### Process Overview

It runs automatically when `convert_webvtt=true`:
WebVTT files in the container are detected based on their extension (.vtt), then converted to MP4/CMFT files and updated to the Blob container.

This process runs before the `generate_manifests()` call, so that created CMFT files will be processed during the manifest generation.

## Implementation Details

### VTT to CMFT Conversion Pipeline

When `convert_webvtt=true`, the application performs a 5-step operation:

1. **Detection**: Identifies WebVTT files (.vtt) in the Azure Blob container
2. **IMSC1 Conversion**: Converts WebVTT to IMSC1 format using the `ttconv` library
3. **Segmentation**: Segments the IMSC1 file using a fixed segment duration (4 seconds)
4. **CMFT Packaging**: Packages segmented IMSC1 into an MP4/CMFT file using the `pymp4`library:
   - Structure: ftyp + moov (with mdhd language encoding) + moof/mdat pairs (one per segment)
5. **Upload**: Uploads the generated CMFT file to the Azure Blob container

### Language Code Extraction

Language codes are extracted from filenames using pattern matching:
- Uses regex `re.split(r'[_\-\.]', filename)` to split on underscores, hyphens, or dots
- Searches all filename segments for 3-letter ISO 639-2/T codes
- Position-independent: Works with `espn1_ARA.vtt`, `ARA_espn1.vtt`, or `espn1.ara.vtt`
- For CMFT files already present: use track metadata language (from mdhd atom) if present, otherwise filename extraction
- if no 3-letter code is found in the VTT file name, the language is set to 'und'

### Language Code Embedding

Language codes are embedded at three levels to ensure proper signalization:
- The `xml:lang` attribute is set on the root `<tt>` element
- Language is encoded in the `mdhd` atom of the CMFT track using 16-bit MP4 format
- The `systemLanguage` attribute is added to text streams in ISM manifests

### VTT File Handling Modes

**Mode 1: convert_webvtt = false** (default)
- VTT files are processed as-is and added to manifests
- FourCC in manifest: "WVTT"

**Mode 2: convert_webvtt = true**
- VTT files are converted to CMFT during preprocessing in Azure and local modes
- Source VTT files are excluded from manifest generation after conversion
- Only generated CMFT files appear in manifests with FourCC "IMSC"

File extensions are processed case-insensitively in both modes. If a raw VTT or TTML file cannot
be parsed, it is skipped while processing continues for the remaining files.

## Error Handling

### VTT to IMSC1 Conversion Errors

**Input Validation**:
- **Empty VTT Content**: Detects and reports empty or whitespace-only VTT content before processing
- **Error Message**: "VTT content is empty or contains only whitespace"

**HTML Sanitization** (when `sanitize_html=True`, default):
- **Automatic Fix**: Removes malformed HTML tags while preserving valid VTT tags (b, i, u, ruby, rt, v, c, lang)
- **Logging**: Reports each fixed issue with cue number and specific tags removed

**Conversion Errors**:
- **AttributeError**: Malformed VTT structure or missing required elements
- **TypeError**: Invalid cue text or HTML parsing issues  
- **ValueError**: Invalid timing formats or other validation errors
- **UnicodeDecodeError**: Character encoding problems

### IMSC1 Segmentation Errors

**XML Parsing Errors**:
- **ET.ParseError**: Invalid XML syntax in IMSC1 content

**Structure Validation**:
- **Missing body element**: IMSC1 missing required `<body>` element
- **Missing div element**: IMSC1 missing required `<div>` element inside body

### CMFT Packaging Errors

**Data Validation**:
- **ValueError**: Invalid segment data or structure
- **struct.error**: Binary data packing issues

### Conversion Summary

After processing completes, a comprehensive summary is displayed showing both VTT conversion and manifest generation results.

The summary provides:
- VTT conversion statistics (successful/total)
- List of files with sanitization warnings (automatically fixed HTML issues)
- List of failed files with specific error reasons
- List of raw (non-converted) VTT/TTML subtitles that were skipped because they could
  not be parsed, with the reason for each
- Manifest generation status (created or skipped)
- Appears at the end of processing, after both VTT conversion and manifest generation

### Manifest Generation Failures

If manifest generation cannot proceed (for example, no `.ism` file and no supported media
file can be found to derive the manifest name from), the tool prints a one-line error
message and exits with a non-zero status instead of a raw stack trace.
